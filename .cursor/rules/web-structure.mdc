# Web App Structure

The `web/` directory contains the Next.js web application. Key structure and conventions:

- Backend logic: ~/../convex/ â€” Convex backend logic, including generated API files, schema definitions, and backend functions for data and authentication.
- Main entry point and layout: ~/app/layout.tsx
- Main page: ~/app/page.tsx
- UI primitives (shared components): ~/components/ui/
- Utility functions: ~/lib/utils.ts
- Global styles: ~/styles/globals.css
- Project configuration: @package.json, @tsconfig.json, @eslint.config.js, @tailwind.config.js

Use the `~/` alias for imports from `src/` (e.g., `~/components/ui/button`).

Each subdirectory is a standalone project with its own dependencies and configuration.
