# Web App Structure

The `web/` directory contains the code for the Next.js web application. Key subdirectories and files:

- `src/app/`: Main app entry, layout, and page components.
- `src/components/`: Shared React components, with a `ui/` subfolder for UI primitives (e.g., button, card, avatar, etc.).
- `src/lib/`: Utility functions.
- `src/styles/`: Global CSS styles.
- `public/`: Static assets, such as the favicon.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts for development, building, and linting.
- `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`: TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS configuration files.

Use this structure to locate pages, components, utilities, and configuration for the web app.
