# Cross-Platform UI Primitives

Both the native and web apps use a set of shared UI primitives (e.g., button, card, avatar) located in:

- `native/components/ui/` for the mobile app
- `web/src/components/ui/` for the web app

These primitives are designed to provide a consistent look and feel across platforms. When adding or updating a UI primitive, consider making corresponding changes in both locations to maintain design consistency.
