# Package Manager Rules

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as its package manager. All dependency management, script running, and installs should be performed using pnpm, **not npm or yarn**.

## Basic Commands

- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Add a dependency: `pnpm add <package>`
- Add a dev dependency: `pnpm add -D <package>`
- Remove a dependency: `pnpm remove <package>`
- Run a script: `pnpm run <script>`
- Run a command similar to `npx`: `pnpm dlx <command>`
- Add a shadcn component: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`

## Best Practices

- Never use `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun` commands in this repository.
- Always check in `pnpm-lock.yaml` with dependency changes.
- Use workspace features if working with multiple packages.
- Prefer `pnpm` for all package management tasks, including CI/CD scripts.
- Do not run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm run dev`. Ask the user to run `pnpm dev` instead.

For more details, see the [pnpm documentation](https://pnpm.io/).
