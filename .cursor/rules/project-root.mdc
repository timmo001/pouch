# Project Root Structure

The project root contains three main subdirectories:

- `convex/`: Convex backend logic, including generated API files, schema definitions, and backend functions for data and authentication.
- `native/`: The Expo/React Native mobile app
- `web/`: The Next.js web app

Each subdirectory is a standalone project with its own dependencies, configuration, and source code. Use the appropriate directory depending on whether you are working on the mobile, web, or backend logic of the app.
