# Project Root Structure

The project root contains two main subdirectories:

- `native/`: The Expo/React Native mobile app
- `web/`: The Next.js web app

Each subdirectory is a standalone project with its own dependencies, configuration, and source code. Use the appropriate directory depending on whether you are working on the mobile or web version of the app.
