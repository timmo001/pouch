# Native App Structure

The `native/` directory contains the code for the mobile (Expo/React Native) app. Key subdirectories and files:

- `app/`: Route and screen definitions, using Expo Router. Auth and home flows are organized in `(auth)/` and `(home)/` folders, with nested layouts and screens.
- `components/`: Shared React components, with a `ui/` subfolder for UI primitives (e.g., button, card, avatar, etc.).
- `lib/`: Utility functions and constants, including an `icons/` subfolder for icon components.
- `../convex/`: Convex backend logic, including generated API files, schema definitions, and backend functions for data and authentication.
- `assets/`: Static assets, such as images and fonts.
- `global.css`, `tailwind.config.js`: Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts for development, building, and cleaning.

Use the `~/` alias for imports from `./` (e.g., `~/components/ui/button`).

Use this structure to locate screens, components, utilities, backend logic, and assets for the native app.
